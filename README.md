# README

This is the project repository of the EPFL Master semester project "Data corruption in plausibly deniable storage: challenges and potential solutions" done by Kilian d'Eternod for the DEDIS laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Vero Estrada-Gali√±anes.

It contains the code that was used for the corruption analysis (in `sflc-corruption`) as well as the redundancy mitigations implemented (in `sflc-redundancy`) with some utilities that were used during testing. 

The base code and instructions for the Shufflecake software is available on its project repository at https://codeberg.org/shufflecake/
