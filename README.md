# README

This is the project repository of the EPFL Master semester project "Data corruption in plausibly deniable storage: challenges and potential solutions" done by Kilian d'Eternod for the DEDIS laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Vero Estrada-Gali√±anes.

It contains the code that was used for the corruption analysis (in `sflc-corruption`) as well as the redundancy mitigations implemented (in `sflc-redundancy`) with some utilities that were used during testing. More information is available inside each of the folders.

To understand and use this code, it is recommended to read the report. The PDF of the report, as well as all the LaTeX files used to generate it are available in the `latex-report` folder.

The base code and instructions for the Shufflecake software is available on its project repository at https://codeberg.org/shufflecake/
